# Employee Management System
A full-stack web application built with .NET Core (C#) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It uses ADO.NET (not Entity Framework) for database connectivity, Select2 for dropdown UI, and DataTables for employee listing



## Features

-  Add new employees

-  View all employees (with pagination + search)

-  Delete employee by ID

- Search employees by first name or department

- Update employee name, salary, or department

- Fully responsive frontend with sidebar navigation

- Connected to MySQL database

- No Entity Framework used — pure ADO.NET

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Select2, DataTables

**Backend** .NET Core, C#, ASP.NET API

**Database** MySQL








##  Software Used

**Backend** 

.NET SDK 6.0+ - For building and running the backend API

Visual Studio Code -as IDE
 
MySQL Server - Database Server

MySQL Workbench - To view and manage the database



**Frontend**

Google Chrome - As a browser to host on

Live Server Extension - Used the extension on Visual Studio to view HTML pages

jQuery - For DOM Manipulation and AJAX

Select2 - For Styled Dropdowns

DataTables - For Enhanced Employee Listing




## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges I encountered during this project was working with JavaScript. Since this was my first full stack project, I was not fully familiar with JavaScript syntax and the vast number of functions available. I often found myself searching online for how certain methods worked, especially when dealing with DOM manipulation, fetch API, error handling, and working with JSON data. It was initially overwhelming to understand how everything connects, especially linking the frontend to backend APIs. However, through continuous trial and error, debugging, and research, I gained a much clearer understanding of how JavaScript powers dynamic functionality in web apps. This experience showed me exactly which areas I need to study further, and it motivated me to keep improving my JavaScript skills.






## Lessons Learned

This was my first ever full-stack project, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I learned a lot about building the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and although I initially struggled with JavaScript—often needing to look up commands online—I gradually started to understand how things work. This process helped me realize what areas I need to focus on to get better with JavaScript, and I'm now more confident about improving in it. To experiment with my project, I also used Select2 and DataTables to insert and view data respectively.  

On the backend, I gained hands-on experience working with API controllers and learned how to structure and handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE in a real-world application using .NET and ADO.NET. Overall, this project gave me a solid foundation in full-stack development and showed me how different layers of an application connect together.
